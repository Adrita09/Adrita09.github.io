                      As a technical editor at iMocha, a B2B SaaS company, I single-handedly deal with proofreading and editing technical content, specifically coding, and project products, for SMB, mid-market, and enterprise clients. I ensure that the content meets the US and UK reviewing standards of Grammarly, and use MS Office applications, Git, VS Studio, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, ASANA, and SharePoint to manage and deliver the content efficiently and effectively.
                      I collaborate with SMEs, in-house editors, freelance editors, and SPOCs to rectify or improvise the content according to the client's requirements and the company's guidelines. I also curate and deliver customer-specific content, leveraging my technical domain and creative skills.
                      I'm pursuing a master's degree in Technical Writing in Business Management from Symbiosis Centre for Distance Learning and have a bachelor's degree in Information Technology Engineering from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology. I am passionate about poetry and public speaking and have won multiple awards and published multiple books.
